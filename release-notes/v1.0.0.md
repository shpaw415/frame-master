# Frame-Master v1.0.0 - Initial Release

**Release Date:** October 2025  
**Status:** Stable

---

## üéâ Welcome to Frame-Master!

We're thrilled to announce the first stable release of **Frame-Master** - a revolutionary approach to full-stack web development powered exclusively by **Bun.js**.

## üß† Core Concept

Frame-Master is **not just another web framework** - it's a **framework maker**. Instead of forcing you into a specific way of building applications, Frame-Master provides a plugin-driven architecture that lets you compose your ideal development stack.

### The Problem We're Solving

Modern web development often forces you to choose between:

- **Framework lock-in**: Commit to Next.js, Remix, or SvelteKit and accept their architectural decisions
- **"Almost perfect" solutions**: Find a framework that's 80% what you need, but compromises on critical features
- **Building from scratch**: Start with a blank canvas but lose valuable tooling and conventions

Frame-Master takes a different approach: **You decide what your framework looks like.**

### How It Works

Frame-Master provides:

1. **A Plugin System** - The heart of Frame-Master. Everything is a plugin:

   - Frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
   - Backend features (databases, authentication, file uploads)
   - Development tools (hot reload, build optimization)
   - Custom business logic

2. **Lifecycle Hooks** - Plugins can hook into every stage of the request/response cycle:

   - `before_request` - Initialize context, check authentication
   - `request` - Handle routing, process requests
   - `after_request` - Modify responses, set cookies
   - `html_rewrite` - Transform HTML before sending to client

3. **Server & Build Control** - Plugins have full control over:

   - Server configuration and routes
   - Build process and optimization
   - File system watching and hot reload
   - WebSocket connections

4. **Bun.js Performance** - Built exclusively for Bun's runtime:
   - Lightning-fast startup times
   - Native TypeScript support
   - Efficient bundling and transpilation
   - Optimized HTTP server

### Configuration-First Design

Your entire framework is defined in a single configuration file:

```typescript
// frame-master.config.ts
import type { FrameMasterConfig } from "frame-master/server/type";
import reactPlugin from "frame-master-plugin-react-ssr/plugin";
import sessionPlugin from "frame-master-plugin-session/plugin";
import tailwindPlugin from "frame-master-plugin-tailwind/plugin";

const config: FrameMasterConfig = {
  HTTPServer: {
    port: 3000,
    hostname: "localhost",
  },
  plugins: [
    reactPlugin({
      // React-specific configuration
    }),
    sessionPlugin({
      secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,
      maxAge: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 7 days
    }),
    tailwindPlugin({
      // Tailwind-specific configuration
    }),
  ],
};

export default config;
```

Want to switch from React to Vue? **Change one line.**  
Need to add authentication? **Add a plugin.**  
Want custom request processing? **Write a plugin.**

## üéØ Philosophy & Design Principles

### 1. **Framework Agnostic**

No opinions on your frontend or backend choices. Use React, Vue, Svelte, or plain JavaScript. Choose PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or SQLite. It's your call.

### 2. **Plugin Everything**

Every feature is a plugin. This means:

- **Modularity** - Only include what you need
- **Maintainability** - Update features independently
- **Extensibility** - Add custom features easily
- **Community** - Share and reuse plugins

### 3. **Configuration Over Convention**

Explicit configuration means:

- **Transparency** - See exactly what your app does
- **Flexibility** - Change behavior without code changes
- **Migration** - Swap implementations easily

### 4. **Performance First**

Built for Bun.js means:

- **Fast startup** - Server ready in milliseconds
- **Efficient bundling** - Optimized build process
- **Low overhead** - Minimal runtime cost
- **Native TypeScript** - No transpilation overhead

### 5. **Developer Experience**

Great DX through:

- **Hot reload** - See changes instantly
- **Type safety** - Full TypeScript support
- **Clear errors** - Helpful error messages
- **Good defaults** - Works out of the box
