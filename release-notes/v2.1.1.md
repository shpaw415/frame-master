# v2.1.1

## CLI Updates

### Template Registry

- Updated API endpoint to `frame-master.com` for template queries.

## Security

### WebToken Package

- **Fixed critical vulnerability**: Removed static IV requirement from AES-256-CBC encryption.
- Encryption now generates a cryptographically secure random IV for each operation.
- This prevents pattern analysis attacks that were possible with static IV reuse.

## Package

- Removed `test-project` directory from the npm package to reduce package size.
