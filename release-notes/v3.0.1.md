# v3.0.1

## Bug Fixes

### Request Manager: HTML Modifiers Applied Only to HTML Responses

Fixed an issue where `HTML_rewrite` plugins and `GlobalValueInjection` were being applied to **all** responses, including JSON and plain text. Now these modifiers are only applied when the response `Content-Type` is `text/html`.

**Before:** JSON responses like `{"data": "test"}` could be corrupted by HTML processing.

**After:** Only HTML responses receive the `globalThis` script injection and HTML rewrite transformations.

### CLI: Plugin Template Variable Replacement

Fixed the `frame-master plugin create` command where the `${name}` variable in `README.template.md` was not being replaced with the actual plugin name.

The `formatTemplateFile` function now correctly handles all three template variables:

- `${NAME}` → plugin name
- `__PluginName__` → plugin name (for package references)
- `__CleanPluginName__` → plugin name without dashes (for JavaScript identifiers)

---

### DirectiveTool: Plugin Config Linkage

Fixed an issue where custom directives defined in plugin configurations were not being registered to the `directiveToolSingleton`. Plugins can now define directives that are automatically available throughout the plugins.

**Usage:**

```typescript
// In your plugin
{
  name: "my-plugin",
  version: "1.0.0",
  directives: [
    {
      name: "use-my-directive",
      regex: /^(?:\s*(?:\/\/.*?\n|\s)*)?['"]use[-\s]my-directive['"];?\s*(?:\/\/.*)?(?:\r?\n|$)/m
    }
  ]
}
```

```typescript
// Now works correctly
import { directiveManager } from "frame-master";

await directiveManager.pathIs("use-my-directive", filePath); // ✓ Returns true if directive is present
```
